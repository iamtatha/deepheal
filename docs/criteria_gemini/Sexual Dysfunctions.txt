    "disorder": "Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction",
    "criteria": "Diagnostic Criteria\nA. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predominant in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):\n1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could include the following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sexual dysfunction.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Occurs on 25%–50% of occasions of sexual activity.\nModerate: Occurs on 50%–75% of occasions of sexual activity.\nSevere: Occurs on 75% or more of occasions of sexual activity."

    "disorder": "Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction",
    "criteria": "This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The other specified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sexual dysfunction. This is done by recording “other specified sexual dysfunction” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “sexual aversion”)."

The unspecified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sexual dysfunction, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis."
