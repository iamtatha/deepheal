        "disorder": "Delusional Disorder",
        "criteria": "A. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer.\nB. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met.\nC. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.\nD. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder."

        "disorder": "Brief Psychotic Disorder",
        "criteria": "A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):\n1. Delusions.\n2. Hallucinations.\n3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).\n4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.\nB. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition."

        "disorder": "Schizophreniform Disorder",
        "criteria": "A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):\n1. Delusions.\n2. Hallucinations.\n3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).\n4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.\n5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).\nB. An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months.\nC. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.\nD. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition."

For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset.\nC. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms.\nD. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.\nF. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated)."
