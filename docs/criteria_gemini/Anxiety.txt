    "criteria": "A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the following:\n1. Recurrent excessive distress when antic ipating or experiencing separation from home or from major attachment figures.\n2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about pos- sible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.\n3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g., getting lost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes separation from a major attachment figure.\n4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.\n5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings.\n6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure.\n7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.\n8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nau- sea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is antici- pated.\nB. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.\nC. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, aca- demic, occupational, or other im portant areas of functioning.\nD. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder."

    "disorder": "Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder",
    "criteria": "A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):\n1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Crite- rion A.\nC. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder that is not substance/ medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder could include the following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\nE. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa- tional, or other important areas of functioning.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\nCoding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica- tion]-induced anxiety disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub- stance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th positio n character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” bef ore the substance-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocai ne-induced anxiety disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one- time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced anxiety disorder.\nSpecify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for di- agnoses associated with substance class):\nWith onset during intoxication: This specifier applies if criteria are met for intoxica- tion with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: This specifier applies if criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medi- cation or after a modification or change in use.\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medicati on-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g ., cocaine, salbutamol) that is  presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is sele cted from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substa nces that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological fact or but the specific class of substance is un- known, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nThe name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in- toxication, onset during withdr awal, with onset duri ng medication use). Unlike the record- ing procedures for ICD-10-CM, which comb ine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder in to a single code, for ICD-9-CM a se parate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring dur- ing withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 loraz- epam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset du ring withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of  anxiety symptoms, each should be listed sep-ICD-10-CM ICD-9-CMWith use disorder, mildWith use disorder, moderate or severeWithout use disorder Alcohol 291.89 F10.180 F10.280 F10.980 Caffeine 292.89 F15.180 F15.280 F15.980 Cannabis 292.89 F12.180 F12.280 F12.980 Phencyclidine 292.89 F16.180 F16.280 F16.980 Other hallucinogen 292.89 F16.180 F16.280 F16.980 Inhalant 292.89 F18.180 F18.280 F18.980 Opioid 292.89 F11.188 F11.288 F11.988 Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic 292.89 F13.180 F13.280 F13.980 Amphetamine (or other stimulant)292.89 F15.180 F15.280 F15.980 Cocaine 292.89 F14.180 F14.280 F14.980 Other (or unknown) substance 292.89 F19.180 F19.280 F19.980 arately (e.g., 292.89 methylphenidate-induced an xiety disorder, with on set during intoxica- tion; 292.89 salbutamol-induced anxiety di sorder, with onset after medication use).\nICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g ., cocaine, salbutamol) that is  presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The di agnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, th e comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced anxiety disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal  in a man with a severe lorazepam use dis- order, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe lor azepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset du ring withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid se- vere lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is no ted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxi- ety disorder, with onset during intoxication).  When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of  anxiety symptoms, each should be listed sep- arately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxica tion; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety dis- order, with onset after medication use)."

The other specified anxiety disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific anxiety disorder. This is done by recording “other specified anxiety disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:\n1.Limited-symptom attacks.\n2.Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not.\n3.Khyâl cap (wind attacks): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Ap- pendix.\n4.Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves): See “Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress” in the Appendix."
