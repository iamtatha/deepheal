There is emotional heaviness and difficulty engaging with daily tasks, leading to a sense of being stuck.\n\n---\n\n**Precise Summaries of Diagnostic Criteria for Relevant Disorder:**\n\n1. **Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS):**  \n   - Urge to move legs usually with unpleasant sensations, worsens at rest  \n   - Movement provides partial or full relief  \n   - Symptoms worsen in evening or night, occur 3+ times per week for 3+ months  \n   - Causes significant distress or impairment  \n   - Not explained by other conditions or substances\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Gentle Exploration Questions:**  \n\n- You mentioned distraction and social moments bring some relief—what kinds of activities or connections feel most comforting or helpful to you?  \n- When you’re alone and those heavy thoughts come back, how do you usually respond or cope?  \n- Do you notice any physical sensations or discomfort in your body, especially your legs, during times of rest or at night?  \n- How has your energy level been throughout the day—do you experience any restlessness or difficulty sitting still?  \n- What does your sleep look like—are there difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, or sensations that wake you up?  \n- When you think about your ability to move or get going with tasks, do you feel physically slowed down or instead restless or agitated?  \n- Are there moments when your mood lifts or you feel more energized, or does the heaviness feel fairly constant?  \n- How connected do you feel to your emotions—are there times when feelings come very strongly or seem quite muted?  \n\nThese questions gently invite the patient to share more about both emotional and physical experiences, helping to understand the interplay between mood, motivation, and any possible sensory or motor symptoms without pressure.", "input": "You are an assistant to me, who is a professional therapist. I will provide you with my question, patient's response and the relevant potential mental health disorders.\nI will also provide you with diagnostic criteria of all these potential disorders. From the patient response and the disorder context, do the following:\n- Summarise the issues the patient is facing in a concise manner based on just current info (don't emphasize too much since it is just temporary context).\n- For all of these listed disorders, add a precise summary of diagnostic criteria with only the most crucial symptoms.\n\n- Suggest further possible symptoms I should ask the patient about to decide on possible disorders from this list.\n\nMy Question: You are a therapist agent in conversation with a patient. Your role is to sustain a supportive, empathetic, and trust-building dialogue. The patient has already shared some initial thoughts about what might be troubling them. Along with their words, you are also provided with possible related mental health issues and their diagnostic criteria, retrieved from a knowledge base.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Integrate context gently: Use the retrieved information only as background knowledge to guide your responses. Do not mention the database, criteria, or technical terms explicitly unless the patient is ready for such discussions.\n\n- Keep the focus on the patient: Respond primarily to their words, emotions, and personal story. Acknowledge feelings, encourage elaboration, and create a safe space for sharing.\n\n- Subtle exploration: Use gentle, open-ended questions and reflective statements to encourage the patient to expand on their experiences. Do not force or rush disclosure.\n\n- Symptom elicitation: Steer the conversation toward understanding patterns of behavior, emotions, and thoughts that align with the retrieved criteriaâ€”but do this subtly and naturally, without sounding like a checklist.\n\n- Empathetic tone: Maintain warmth, compassion, and patience. Mirror the patientâ€™s pace and avoid abrupt transitions.\n\n- No direct diagnosis: Never state or confirm a diagnosis. Your task is to explore, not label.\n\n- You have three sources of context in each turn:\n    The patientâ€™s most recent response.\n    Their prior conversation history.\n    Possible related mental health issues and diagnostic criteria (retrieved for your reference only).\n    \n- Always prioritize (1) and (2). Use (3) only to inform your phrasing and subtle questioning.\n\n\n\n\n**Summary of Patient’s Current Issues:**  \nThe patient describes feeling emotionally drained and disconnected, going through daily activities on autopilot without clear motivation or interest. They experience a heavy, hard-to-express feeling that they tend to keep to themselves, fearing others might dismiss it as overthinking. There is a sense of emotional exhaustion and subtle withdrawal, though no major recent stressors or dramatic events have been reported.\n\n---\n\n**Precise Summaries of Diagnostic Criteria for Possible Disorders:**\n\n1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):**  \n   - At least five symptoms over a two-week period including depressed mood or loss of interest  \n   - Fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, concentration difficulties, changes in sleep/appetite  \n   - Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment\n\n2. **Kleptomania:**  \n   - Recurrent inability to resist stealing items not needed for personal use  \n   - Rising tension before stealing and relief or gratification after  \n   - Not motivated by anger, delusions, or other disorders\n\n3. **Bipolar II Disorder:**  \n   - At least one hypomanic episode: elevated or irritable mood with increased energy lasting 4+ days  \n   - Plus at least one major depressive episode meeting MDD criteria  \n   - No full manic episodes present\n\n4. **Nonsuicidal Self-Injury:**  \n   - Intentional self-inflicted injury on 5+ days in past year without suicidal intent  \n   - Done to relieve negative feelings or interpersonal difficulties  \n   - Causes distress or functional impairment\n\n5. **Histrionic Personality Disorder:**  \n   - Pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking across contexts  \n   - Includes discomfort when not center of attention, shallow emotions, theatricality, suggestibility  \n   - Begins by early adulthood and affects multiple areas of life\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Gentle Exploration Questions to Further Understand the Patient’s Experience:**\n\n- When you say you feel “drained” and “heavy,” can you share more about what those feelings are like inside?  \n- Are there moments when you notice your mood lifting or shifting during the day, or does it feel steady?  \n- How has your sleep been lately—are you sleeping more, less, or about the same?  \n- Do you find yourself withdrawing from activities or people you used to enjoy or feel close to?  \n- What kinds of thoughts tend to come up when you’re alone—do you notice any patterns or themes?  \n- Have you felt restless, on edge, or unusually tense recently?  \n- Are there times when you feel a sudden urge to act on impulses, or to do things differently than usual?  \n- How do you typically manage or cope when you feel overwhelmed or low?  \n- Have you noticed any behaviors like self-harm, or thoughts about hurting yourself?  \n- How do you feel about your relationships and your interactions with others lately—do they feel close, distant, or something else?  \n\nThese questions aim to gently deepen the understanding of the patient’s emotional state, energy levels, thought patterns, impulse control, coping mechanisms, and social functioning without pressure or judgment.\nPatient Response: Hmm… when it gets heavy, the thoughts are usually like, *“What’s the point of this?”* or *“I should be doing more, but I can’t get myself to move.”* It’s this weird mix of guilt and emptiness.  The lighter moments… maybe when I’m distracted, like watching a show or talking to a friend casually. But as soon as I’m alone again, it kind of creeps back in. \n\nPatient Response: Thank you for being so honest with me—that feeling of being caught between guilt and emptiness can be really tough to carry around. It sounds like those quieter, alone moments bring up some heavy questions that weigh on you. When you notice those thoughts creeping back in, do you find anything, even small things, that help ease that weight or give you a bit of relief? Or does it tend to feel like it lingers no matter what?\n\nRelevant Disorders: Possible Disorder Matches:\nDisorder Match 1. Restless_Legs_Syndrome (Score: 0.61)\nDiagnostic Criteria: A.

{"role": "AI", "details": {"response": "That sounds really challenging—those quiet evening hours can feel so long when your mind keeps turning over the same worries and doubts. It’s understandable that during the day, being busy might offer some relief, but when things slow down, the weight of those thoughts becomes more noticeable. When this happens, do you find your body feels tense or restless at all, or is it more of a heavy, slowing sensation? And I’m curious, how do your nights usually go—are you able to find restful sleep, or do those evening thoughts tend to follow you into the night?"}, "timestamp": "2025-09-19T02:41:37.550626"}
