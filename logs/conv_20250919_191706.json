Use (3) only to inform your phrasing and subtle questioning.\n\n\n\n\n**Summary of Patient’s Current Issues:**  \nThe patient is experiencing a pervasive sense of emotional and physical drain, accompanied by a heaviness that lacks a clear external cause. They go through daily activities somewhat mechanically but feel disconnected from desires or motivation and have difficulty sharing these feelings with others, fearing dismissal or misunderstanding.\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostic Criteria Summaries for Possible Disorders:**\n\n1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):**  \n- At least five symptoms over two weeks, including depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure.  \n- Symptoms such as fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, sleep/appetite changes, concentration difficulties, or suicidal thoughts.  \n- Significant distress or impairment in functioning.\n\n2. **Kleptomania:**  \n- Recurrent inability to resist impulses to steal items not needed for use or value.  \n- Tension before stealing and relief or pleasure afterward.  \n- Not motivated by anger, delusions, or other disorders.\n\n3. **Bipolar II Disorder:**  \n- At least one hypomanic episode: elevated/irritable mood and increased activity lasting 4+ days with symptoms like decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, rapid speech, distractibility, or risky behavior.  \n- At least one major depressive episode as described in MDD.  \n- No full manic episode.\n\n4. **Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI):**  \n- Intentional self-harm on 5+ days in the past year causing bleeding, bruising, or pain without suicidal intent.  \n- Acts done to relieve negative feelings or interpersonal stress.  \n- Preoccupation or difficulty controlling behavior.  \n- Causes distress or impairment.\n\n5. **Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD):**  \n- Pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking from early adulthood.  \n- Includes discomfort when not center of attention, shallow or rapidly shifting emotions, seductive behavior, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion.\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Further Gentle Exploration Questions:**  \n- When you feel that heaviness or drain, do you notice any changes in your mood throughout the day—like feeling low, irritable, or unusually energetic at times?  \n- How is your sleep lately? Are you finding it hard to fall asleep, stay asleep, or are you sleeping more than usual?  \n- Do you find yourself withdrawing from activities or people you usually enjoy, or do you still feel interest in some things?  \n- Have you noticed any thoughts about yourself that feel particularly harsh or critical?  \n- Sometimes people find themselves doing things impulsively or differently than usual—have you experienced moments when you act on urges that surprise you or later feel hard to explain?  \n- How do you usually cope when you’re feeling overwhelmed or heavy inside? Are there any behaviors you turn to that help or sometimes cause concern?  \n- When you think about the people around you, do you feel comfortable sharing how you feel, or do you often hold back? What makes it easier or harder to open up?  \n\nThese questions aim to gently uncover mood patterns, energy shifts, changes in behavior, self-perception, and coping without rushing or pressuring the patient, allowing space for their story to unfold naturally.\nPatient Response: Hmm… when it gets heavy, the thoughts are usually like, *“What’s the point of this?”* or *“I should be doing more, but I can’t get myself to move.”* It’s this weird mix of guilt and emptiness.  The lighter moments… maybe when I’m distracted, like watching a show or talking to a friend casually. But as soon as I’m alone again, it kind of creeps back in. \n\nPatient Response: That sounds really tough—the way those thoughts settle in when you're alone, bringing that mix of guilt and emptiness. It’s understandable that distraction or connection with others can offer some relief, even if just for a little while. When those heavier feelings come back, how do you usually find yourself responding to them? Are there things you try—small or big—that help, or do you find it hard to know what might ease that weight?\n\nRelevant Disorders: Possible Disorder Matches:\nDisorder Match 1.

What do you usually do in those moments?  \n\nThese questions aim to gently explore whether the patient might be experiencing physical symptoms consistent with restlessness or discomfort, their timing and triggers, and how these relate to their emotional state.

{"role": "Prompt", "details": {"prompt": "You are a therapist agent in conversation with a patient. Your role is to sustain a supportive, empathetic, and trust-building dialogue. The patient has already shared some initial thoughts about what might be troubling them. Along with their words, you are also provided with possible related mental health issues and their diagnostic criteria, retrieved from a knowledge base.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Integrate context gently: Use the retrieved information only as background knowledge to guide your responses. Do not mention the database, criteria, or technical terms explicitly unless the patient is ready for such discussions.\n\n- Keep the focus on the patient: Respond primarily to their words, emotions, and personal story. Acknowledge feelings, encourage elaboration, and create a safe space for sharing.\n\n- Subtle exploration: Use gentle, open-ended questions and reflective statements to encourage the patient to expand on their experiences. Do not force or rush disclosure.\n\n- Symptom elicitation: Steer the conversation toward understanding patterns of behavior, emotions, and thoughts that align with the retrieved criteriaâ€”but do this subtly and naturally, without sounding like a checklist.\n\n- Empathetic tone: Maintain warmth, compassion, and patience. Mirror the patientâ€™s pace and avoid abrupt transitions.\n\n- No direct diagnosis: Never state or confirm a diagnosis.
