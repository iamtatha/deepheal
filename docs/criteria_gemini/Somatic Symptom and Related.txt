    "disorder": "Illness Anxiety Disorder",
    "criteria": "A. Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. B. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity.

C. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed about personal health status. D. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and hospitals). E. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific illness that is feared may change over that period of time. F. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type.

The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder. D. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for conversion disorder is 300.11, which is assigned regardless of the symptom type. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the symptom type (see below). Specify symptom type: (F44.4) With weakness or paralysis (F44.4) With abnormal movement (e.g., tremor, dystonic movement, myoclonus, gait disorder) (F44.4) With swallowing symptoms (F44.4) With speech symptom (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech) (F44.5) With attacks or seizures (F44.6) With anesthesia or sensory loss (F44.6) With special sensory symptom (e.g., visual, olfactory, or hearing disturbance) (F44.7) With mixed symptoms Specify if: Acute episode: Symptoms present for less than 6 months.

    "disorder": "Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions",
    "criteria": "A. A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present. B. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of the following ways: 1. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as shown by a close temporal association between the psychological factors and the development or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition. 2. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor adherence). 3. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual. 4. The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacerbating symptoms or necessitating medical attention. C. The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder). Specify current severity: Mild: Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with antihypertension treatment). Moderate: Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating asthma). Severe: Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit. Extreme: Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring heart attack symptoms)."
