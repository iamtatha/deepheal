    "disorder": "Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)",
    "criteria": "Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:\nA. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.\nB. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and socio- cultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongo- ing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.\nC. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period."

    "disorder": "Global Developmental Delay",
    "criteria": "This diagnosis is reserved for individuals under the age of 5 years when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood. This category is diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellec- tual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assess- ments of intellectual functioning, including children who are too young to participate in standardized testing. This category requires reassessment after a period of time."

  {
    "disorder": "Unspecified Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)",
    "criteria": "This category is reserved for individuals over the age of 5 years when assessment of the degree of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) by means of locally available procedures is rendered difficult or impossible because of associated sensory or physical impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor disability; or pres- ence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring mental disorder. This category should only be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time."

  {
    "disorder": "Language Disorder",
    "criteria": "A. Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language across modalities (i.e., spoken, written, sign language, or other) due to deficits in comprehension or produc- tion that include the following:\n1. Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).\n2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings together to form sentences based on the rules of grammar and morphology).\n3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and connect sentences to ex- plain or describe a topic or series of events or have a conversation).\nB. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, re- sulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, aca- demic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.\nC. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.\nD. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor dys- function, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better explained by in- tellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay."

  {
    "disorder": "Speech Sound Disorder",
    "criteria": "A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intelligi- bility or prevents verbal communication of messages.\nB. The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.\nC. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.\nD. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions, such as cere- bral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medi- cal or neurological conditions."

  {
    "disorder": "Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)",
    "criteria": "A. Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech that are inappropri- ate for the individual’s age and language skills, persist over time, and are characterized by frequent and marked occurrences of one (or more) of the following:\n1. Sound and syllable repetitions.\n2. Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.\n3. Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).\n4. Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).\n5. Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words).\n6. Words produced with an excess of physical tension.\n7. Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I see him”).\nB. The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in effective communica- tion, social participation, or academic or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.\nC. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. (Note: Later-onset cases are diagnosed as 307.0 [F98.5] adult-onset fluency disorder.)\nD. The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, dysfluency as- sociated with neurological insult (e.g., stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical con- dition and is not better explained by another mental disorder."

  {
    "disorder": "Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder",
    "criteria": "A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as man- ifested by all of the following:\n1. Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharing information, in a manner that is appropriate for the social context.\n2. Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a playground, talk- ing differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.\n3. Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.\n4. Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).\nB. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participa- tion, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance, indi- vidually or in combination.\nC. The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental period (but deficits may not become fully manifest until social communication demands exceed limited capacities).\nD. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental disorder."

    "disorder": "Unspecified Communication Disorder",
    "criteria": "This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of communication disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for com- munication disorder or for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diag- nostic class. The unspecified communication disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for com- munication disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presen- tations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis."

    "disorder": "Autism Spectrum Disorder",
    "criteria": "A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple con- texts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):\n1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.\n2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnor- malities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.\n3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging, for ex- ample, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, re- petitive patterns of behavior (seeTable 2).\nB. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaus- tive; see text):\n1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).\n2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food every day).\n3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circum- scribed or perseverative interests).\n4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse re- sponse to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).\nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, re- petitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2).\nC. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).\nD. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other im- portant areas of current functioning.\nE. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual devel- opmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spec- trum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that ex- pected for general developmental level."

    "criteria": "A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2):\n1.Inattention: Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that nega- tively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:\nNote: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defi- ance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.\na. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).\nb.

Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years.\nC. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more set- tings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).\nD. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, so- cial, academic, or occupational functioning.\nE. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intox- ication or withdrawal)."

    "disorder": "Specific Learning Disorder",
    "criteria": "A. Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by the presence of at least one of the following symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months, despite the provision of interventions that target those difficulties:\n1. Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud incor- rectly or slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty sounding out words).\n2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (e.g., may read text accurately but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read).\n3. Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or consonants).\n4. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical or punctua- tion errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph organization; written expres- sion of ideas lacks clarity).\n5. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g., has poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships; counts on fingers to add single-digit numbers instead of recalling the math fact as peers do; gets lost in the midst of arithmetic computation and may switch procedures).\n6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g., has severe difficulty applying math- ematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).\nB. The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for the individual’s chronological age, and cause significant interference with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by individu- ally administered standardized achievement measures and comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals age 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing learning difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment.\nC. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully man- ifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individual’s lim- ited capacities (e.g., as in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).\nD. The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, uncor- rected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate educational instruction.\nNote: The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical synthesis of the indi- vidual’s history (developmental, medical, family, educational), school reports, and psycho- educational assessment."
