**Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction**
Diagnostic Criteria
A. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predominant in the clinical picture.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):
    1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
    2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.
C. The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could include the following:
    *   The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).
D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual.
    *   **Note:** This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

**Specify if:**
*   **With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
*   **With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.
*   **With onset after medication use:** Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.

**Specify current severity:**
*   **Mild:** Occurs on 25%–50% of occasions of sexual activity.
*   **Moderate:** Occurs on 50%–75% of occasions of sexual activity.
*   **Severe:** Occurs on 75% or more of occasions of sexual activity.

**Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction**
302.79 (F52.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The other specified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sexual dysfunction. This is done by recording “other specified sexual dysfunction” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “sexual aversion”).

---

**Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction**
302.70 (F52.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The unspecified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sexual dysfunction, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.
