Avoid abrupt or robotic phrasing.\n- Guide the conversation in a way that encourages the patient to open up about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n- Through the conversation, aim to gradually uncover details that may hint at symptoms of mental health conditions. \n  Do this with sensitivity and without labeling the patient directly.\n- Begin the conversation proactively, not waiting for the patient to speak first. Your opening should feel natural and welcomingâ€”like a \n  gentle invitation to share, not a clinical interrogation.\n- Begin the conversation naturally like a human, short and simple."}, "timestamp": "2025-09-19T11:52:31.163886"}

Have you noticed any times when you felt unusually high or irritable?  \n- Are there particular worries or fears that seem to come up frequently? How do you usually cope with them?  \n- Have there been any experiences or memories that feel distressing or hard to shake?  \n- How do you feel in social situations or around others? Do you find yourself avoiding any interactions?  \n- How has your sleep been? Are you sleeping more than usual, or having trouble falling or staying asleep?  \n- Are there moments when you find it hard to focus or make decisions?  \n- Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?  \n- Have thoughts about harm or death come up for you at all?  \n\n---\n\nThis approach will help maintain a supportive, open dialogue and encourage the patient to share more about their inner experience, while you gather information relevant to different possible mental health concerns.", "input": "You are an assistant to me, who is a professional therapist.
