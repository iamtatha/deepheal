        "disorder": "Bipolar I Disorder",
        "criteria": "For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.\n\nA. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A–D under “Manic Episode” above).\nB. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.\nNote: At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. Hypomanic episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. Major depressive episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder."

        "disorder": "Manic Episode",
        "criteria": "A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).\nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.\nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.\nNote: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis."

        "disorder": "Hypomanic Episode",
        "criteria": "A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).\nC. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.\nD. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.\nE. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.\nF. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).\nNote: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis."

(Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\nC.

        "disorder": "Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder",
        "criteria": "This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific bipolar and related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified bipolar and related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration cyclothymia”).\nExamples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:\n1. Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2–3 days) and major depressive episodes: A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced two or more episodes of short-duration hypomania that meet the full symptomatic criteria for a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2–3 days. The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.\n2. Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive episodes: A lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that do not meet full symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days of elevated mood and one or two of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode, or irritable mood and two or three of the other symptoms of a hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed features.\n3. Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode: One or more hypomanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode. If this occurs in an individual with an established diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), both diagnoses can be concurrently applied during the periods when the full criteria for a hypomanic episode are met.\n4. Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months): Multiple episodes of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and multiple episodes of depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode that persist over a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months for children or adolescents) in an individual whose presentation has never met full criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and does not meet criteria for any psychotic disorder. During the course of the disorder, the hypomanic or depressive symptoms are present for more days than not, the individual has not been without symptoms for more than 2 months at a time, and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment."

The unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings)."
