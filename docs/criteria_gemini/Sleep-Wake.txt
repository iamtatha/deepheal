    "disorder": "Insomnia Disorder",
    "criteria": "Diagnostic Criteria 307.42 (F51.01)\nA. A predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associated with one (or more) of the following symptoms:\n1. Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty initiating sleep without caregiver intervention.)\n2. Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems returning to sleep after awakenings. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty returning to sleep without caregiver intervention.)\n3. Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.\nB. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.\nC. The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week.\nD. The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months.\nE. The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.\nF. The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep disorder, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia).\nG. The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).\nH. Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of insomnia.\nSpecify if:\nWith non–sleep disorder mental comorbidity, including substance use disorders\nWith other medical comorbidity\nWith other sleep disorder\nCoding note: The code 307.42 (F51.01) applies to all three specifiers. Code also the relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder immediately after the code for insomnia disorder in order to indicate the association.\nSpecify if:\nEpisodic: Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.\nPersistent: Symptoms last 3 months or longer.\nRecurrent: Two (or more) episodes within the space of 1 year.\nNote: Acute and short-term insomnia (i.e., symptoms lasting less than 3 months but otherwise meeting all criteria with regard to frequency, intensity, distress, and/or impairment) should be coded as an other specified insomnia disorder.\nNote. The diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given whether it occurs as an independent condition or is comorbid with another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder), medical condition (e.g., pain), or another sleep disorder (e.g., a breathing-related sleep disorder). For instance, insomnia may develop its own course with some anxiety and depressive features but in the absence of criteria being met for any one mental disorder. Insomnia may also manifest as a clinical feature of a more predominant mental disorder. Persistent insomnia may even be a risk factor for depression and is a common residual symptom after treatment for this condition. With comorbid insomnia and a mental disorder, treatment may also need to target both conditions. Given these different courses, it is often impossible to establish the precise nature of the relationship between these clinical entities, and this relationship may change over time. Therefore, in the presence of insomnia and a comorbid disorder, it is not necessary to make a causal attribution between the two conditions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is made with concurrent specification of the clinically comorbid conditions. A concurrent insomnia diagnosis should only be considered when the insomnia is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention; otherwise, no separate diagnosis is necessary."
