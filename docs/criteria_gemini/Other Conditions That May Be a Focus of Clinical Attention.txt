    "disorder": "Malingering",
    "criteria": "The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding military duty, avoiding work, obtaining financial compensation, evading criminal prosecution, or obtaining drugs. Under some circumstances, malingering may represent adaptive behavior—for example, feigning illness while a captive of the enemy during wartime. Malingering should be strongly suspected if any combination of the following is noted: 1. Medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the individual is referred by an attorney to the clinician for examination, or the individual self-refers while litigation or criminal charges are pending). 2. Marked discrepancy between the individual’s claimed stress or disability and the objective findings and observations. 3. Lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in complying with the prescribed treatment regimen. 4. The presence of antisocial personality disorder."
