**Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders (General Criteria)**

A. The disorder represents a clinically significant symptomatic presentation of a relevant mental disorder.
B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both of the following:
    1. The disorder developed during or within 1 month of a substance intoxication or withdrawal or taking a medication; and
    2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the mental disorder.

    2. The full mental disorder persisted for a substantial period of time (e.g., at least 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication or taking the medication. This criterion does not apply to substance-induced neurocognitive disorders or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, which persist beyond the cessation of acute intoxication or withdrawal.
D. The disorder does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
E. The disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
