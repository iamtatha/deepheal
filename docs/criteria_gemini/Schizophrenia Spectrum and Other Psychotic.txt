If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nSpecify whether:\nErotomanic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with the individual.\nGrandiose type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is the conviction of having some great (but unrecognized) talent or insight or having made some important discovery.\nJealous type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the individual’s delusion is that his or her spouse or lover is unfaithful.\nPersecutory type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves the individual’s belief that he or she is being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals.\nSomatic type: This subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations.\nMixed type: This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates.\nUnspecified type: This subtype applies when the dominant delusional belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific types (e.g., referential delusions without a prominent persecutory or grandiose component).\nSpecify if:\nWith bizarre content: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not understandable, and not derived from ordinary life experiences (e.g., an individual’s belief that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them with someone else’s organs without leaving any wounds or scars).\nSpecify if:\nThe following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the disorder:\nFirst episode, currently in acute episode: First manifestation of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic symptom and time criteria.
