        "disorder": "Other Specified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 (F64.8)",
        "criteria": "This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria. The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria. This is done by recording “other specified gender dysphoria” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief gender dysphoria”). An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” designation is the following: The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria, but the duration is less than 6 months."

The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis."
